  abstract = {Small bodies such as asteroids and comets display great variability in terms of surface morphological features. These are often unknown beforehand but can be employed for hazard avoidance during landing, autonomous planning of scientific observations, and navigation purposes. Algorithms performing these tasks are often data driven, which means they require realistic, sizeable, and annotated datasets, which in turn may rely heavily on human intervention. This work develops a methodology to generate synthetic, automatically labeled datasets that are used in conjunction with real, manually labeled ones to train deep-learning architectures in the task of semantic segmentation. This functionality is achieved by designing U-shaped network architectures trained with different strategies. These show good generalization capabilities, implement uncertainty quantification estimates, and can be hybridized to exploit qualities from multiple networks.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
