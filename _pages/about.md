I am a curious, ambitious, and creative researcher. My areas of interest are autonomous optical navigation, artificial intelligence, GNC, and small-bodies exploration. Since November 2019 I am a PhD student at the DART group, Politecnico di Milano, and Early Stage Researcher (ESR) of the H2020 StardustR Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie network on asteroids and space debris under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Topputo. My research has been focused on embedding data-driven image-processing perception algorithms for autonomous navigation, segmentation, hazard detection, and shape recognition with small irregular celestial bodies such as comets and asteroids. My career goal is to become a specialist in interplanetary missions and design of cutting-edge autonomous, optical-based systems.

I am always searching for new opportunities to expand my research and collaborate with experts from diverse fields in pursuit of my goals. I have always liked a good challenge and with this mentality I have traveled the world as a space engineer, gaining valuable experiences both from a personal and professional standpoint. I have had the privilege of visiting and working in several locations, including Bremen (DFKI), Tucson (University of Arizona), Madrid (GMV), Tokyo (ISAS/JAXA), Friedrichshafen (Airbus Defense and Space), Delft (TU Delft), and my hometown of Milan (Politecnico di Milano). To date, I have contributed to CubeSat (Milani, EQUULEUS), smallsat (DESTINY+), and traditional (HERA) missions, as well as research projects with national (ASI, ESA) and international (JAXA, NASA) space agencies at various capacities.
