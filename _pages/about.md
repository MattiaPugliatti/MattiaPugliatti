I am a curious, ambitious and creative researcher. My areas of interest are autonomous optical navigation, artificial intelligence, GNC, and small-bodies exploration. My career goal is to become a specialist in interplanetary
missions and design of autonomous, optical-based systems.

Since November 2019 I am a PhD student at the DART group, Politecnico di Milano, and Early Stage Researcher (ESR) of the H2020 StardustR Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie network on asteroids and space debris under the supervision of Prof. Francesco Topputo. My research has been focused on embedding data-driven image processing perception algorithms for autonomous navigation, segmentation, hazard detection, and shape recognition with small irregular celestial bodies such as comets and asteroids. 

I have always liked a good challenge. Over the year this mentality has brought me to different places around the world that have greatly enriched me both as a person and as a space engineer. I have contributed to CubeSat (Milani, EQUULEUS), smallsats (DESTINY+), and traditional (HERA) missions in desparate settings over the years: Bremen, Tucson, Madrid, Tokyo, Delft, Friedrichshafen, Milan.
